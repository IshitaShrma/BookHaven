# BookHaven
The BookHaven is an online Book Store. It is a web-based minor project that allows users to explore, search, and order books through an interactive and user-friendly interface. The system provides essential features such as user registration, login, browsing through book categories, searching for specific books, and placing orders.

This project aims to replicate the functionality of an e-commerce platform focused on books, offering users a seamless experience of shopping for books online. It is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies including HTML, CSS, Java, JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL for database management.

## Key Features
1. ### User Authentication:
   - Users can register and create an account.
   - Registered users can log in using their credentials.
2. ### Book Browsing & Searching:
   - Users can explore a variety of books categorized by genres or authors.
   - A search feature allows users to search for books by title, author, or keyword.
3. ### Ordering Books:
   - Users can add books to their cart and place orders.
   - Order history is stored for each user.

## Technologies Used
- ### Frontend:
  - HTML and CSS for building the user interface.
- ### Backend:
  - Java for implementing business logic.
  - JSP (JavaServer Pages) for rendering dynamic web pages.
  - Servlets for handling requests and responses between the client and server.
- ### Database:
  - MySQL for storing user data, book details, and order history.
  - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for interacting with the MySQL database.

## How it Works
1. Users need to sign up or log in to access the bookstore.
2. Once logged in, they can browse or search for books, view details, and add them to their cart.
3. Orders can be placed, and the system keeps track of order history, allowing users to revisit previous orders.
